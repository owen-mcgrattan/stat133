# HW 04

- This was certainly the most difficult work I've done in the class so far.  It was my first time working with ggvis and Shiny.  There is certainly a steep learning curve and I hope to get over that sometime soon because they're incredibly useful tools.  The data cleaning and function writing was more monotonous than anything and I really didn't enjoy the test writing but it all felt gratifying and worthwhile when I was going through the shiny app and I was able to call on some useful funcitons that helped me get through that work.
