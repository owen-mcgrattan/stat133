A quick and *easy* meal to do that is perfect for anyone trying to cook a meal in  under **twenty** minutes! 

If you'd like to do more of a panko breaded chicken, please go [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiPi5S1tpnWAhUX-2MKHVMiABUQFggwMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fallrecipes.com%2Frecipe%2F239428%2Fcrispy-panko-chicken-breasts%2F&usg=AFQjCNF_-gNQIvlGzc9G2p3W_bbEEj6QCQ)

First the list of ingredients you'll need 

* Butter 
* Boneless Chicken tenders (or your choice of chicken, just know that thicker pieces of chicken will take longer!)
* Flour
* Salt
* Pepper 
* Green beans (or baccicia beans if you have them!)

Nothing particularly special needed in the kitchen besides
* Cutting board
* Non-stick general sized pan


I'll get into the prep and cooking for the chicken first. 

1. First, layout your chicken on the cutting board. 
2. Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper (or whatever seasoning you prefer)
3. Set out a plate with a decent amount of flour. Bread both sides of the strips in the flower you have a nice white coating all around
4. Heat up the stove and set it on high. Before putting the chicken in, set in an eighth of a stick of butter and spread it around the pan. Let it sit until it starts to sizzle and turn brown.
5. When the butter is browned and sizzling in the pan, place the chicken in and cook both sides until the bottom is golden brown (Generally 5 min but varies on thickness of the slice). If you don't see much butter sizzling and browning as you cook, be sure to add butter as necessary. 

Prepping green beans
1. Clean green beans, twist off ends if they're still there. 
2. Place beans in pan (or pot) and fill with water up to roughly 1/3 of the way up the beans, a nice shallow pool.
3. Steam the beans until they're slightly soft, then drain. 
4. Place the beans back on the stove and cook with a thin slice of butter in the pan until the beans are starting to turn golden brown on the outside.

*And you're all set!*

It's the perfect meal for anyone trying to cook at home in a hurry or anyone trying to eat for under roughly $7! Throughout the whole process you can cook with oil and everything should turn out just fine. 

## The Quadratic Equation

\[ ax^2+bx+c=0 \]

The quadratic formula is useful for finding the x-intercepts for a graph.

\[ x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \]

## Conclusion

It may take a little while to get used to how the headings work, but everything is simple enough that it'll become easier with practice. It took me roughly 35 minutes to complete all of the work which was a little bit longer than I expected.  I had to refer to the Latex guide and others for sure and constantly going back to the markdown tutorial.  I have had some experience working with R markdown before but nothing really regarding more of the presentational aspect of setting up a clean looking file with proper headings, boldings, etc.
